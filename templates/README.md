## Apache Karaf {{= fp.config.version.version}}

A simple docker build for installing a vanilla Karaf {{= fp.config.version.version}} below */opt/karaf*. It comes out of the box and is intended for use for integration testing.

During startup a directory specified by the environment variable `DEPLOY_DIR` (*/deployments* by default) is checked for .war files. If there are any, they are linked into the *webapps/* directory for automatic deployment. This plays nicely with the [docker-maven-plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin/) and its 'assembly' mode which can automatically create Docker data container with Maven artifacts exposed from a directory */deployments*.
### Agent Bond

For this image [Agent Bond](https://github.com/fabric8io/agent-bond) is enabled. Agent Bond exports metrics from [Jolokia](http://www.jolokia.org) and [jmx_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter).

Please refer to the base image's [documentation]({{= fp.config.version.from.repo }}) for available options to tune the Java JVM.
