## Fabric8 Server Base Images

This repository holds a set of useful Docker base images for various application servers:

| Image | Description  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **[tomcat](#application-servers)** | Tomcat 5.5, 6 - 9 images |
| **[jetty](#application-servers)** | Jetty 7 - 9 images |
| **[karaf](#application-servers)** | Karaf 2.4, 3 and 4 images |

The Docker build files for these images are generated by
[fish-pepper](https://github.com/rhuss/fish-pepper), a sophisticated
template system for generation Docker builds. `fish-pepper` allows
the composition of various building block so that parametrized Docker
builds are easy possible.

In order to regenerate all Dockerfiles from the provided templates you
need only to install `fish-pepper` via npm (assuming that you have
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed)

```
npm -g install fish-pepper
fish-pepper
```

All server images are enabled with `agent-bond` since they are derived from the
base images described above. You can use the same environment
variables to setup the agents.

The following applicaton servers are supported:

* Tomcat:
