## Apache Karaf 4.0.5

A simple docker build for installing a vanilla Karaf 4.0.5 below */opt/karaf*. It comes out of the box and is intended for use for integration testing.

During startup a directory specified by the environment variable `DEPLOY_DIR` (*/deployments* by default) is checked for .war files. If there are any, they are linked into the *webapps/* directory for automatic deployment. This plays nicely with the [docker-maven-plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin/) and its 'assembly' mode which can automatically create Docker data container with Maven artifacts exposed from a directory */deployments*.

### Agent Bond

For this image [Agent Bond](https://github.com/fabric8io/agent-bond) is enabled. Agent Bond exports metrics from [Jolokia](http://www.jolokia.org) and [jmx_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter).

The agent is installed as `/opt/agent-bond/agent-bond.jar` and enables the following agents by default:

* [Jolokia](http://www.jolokia.org) : version **undefined** and port **8778**
* [jmx_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter): version **undefined** and port **9779**

You can influence the behaviour of `agent-bond-opts` by setting various environment variables:

### Agent-Bond Options

Agent bond itself can be influenced with the following environment variables: 

* **AB_OFF** : If set disables activation of agent-bond (i.e. echos an empty value). By default, agent-bond is enabled.
* **AB_ENABLED** : Comma separated list of sub-agents enabled. Currently allowed values are `jolokia` and `jmx_exporter`. 
  By default both are enabled.


#### Jolokia configuration

* **AB_JOLOKIA_CONFIG** : If set uses this file (including path) as Jolokia JVM agent properties (as described 
  in Jolokia's [reference manual](http://www.jolokia.org/reference/html/agents.html#agents-jvm)).
  By default this is `/opt/jolokia/jolokia.properties`.
* **AB_JOLOKIA_HOST** : Host address to bind to (Default: `0.0.0.0`)
* **AB_JOLOKIA_PORT** : Port to use (Default: `8778`)
* **AB_JOLOKIA_USER** : User for authentication. By default authentication is switched off.
* **AB_JOLOKIA_HTTPS** : Switch on secure communication with https. By default self signed server certificates are generated
  if no `serverCert` configuration is given in `AB_JOLOKIA_OPTS`
* **AB_JOLOKIA_PASSWORD** : Password for authentication. By default authentication is switched off.
* **AB_JOLOKIA_ID** : Agent ID to use (`$HOSTNAME` by default, which is the container id)
* **AB_JOLOKIA_OPTS**  : Additional options to be appended to the agent opts. They should be given in the format 
  "key=value,key=value,..."

Some options for integration in various environments:

* **AB_JOLOKIA_AUTH_OPENSHIFT** : Switch on client authentication for OpenShift TSL communication. The value of this 
  parameter can be a relative distinguished name which must be contained in a presented client certificate. Enabling this
  parameter will automatically switch Jolokia into https communication mode. The default CA cert is set to 
  `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt` 
  
#### jmx_exporter configuration

* **AB_JMX_EXPORTER_OPTS** : Configuration to use for `jmx_exporter` (in the format `<port>:<path to config>`)
* **AB_JMX_EXPORTER_PORT** : Port to use for the JMX Exporter. Default: `9779`
* **AB_JMX_EXPORTER_CONFIG** : Path to configuration to use for `jmx_exporter`: Default: `/opt/agent-bond/jmx_exporter_config.json`



Features:

* Karaf Version: **4.0.5**
* Java Base image: **jboss/base-jdk:8**
* Port: **8080**
* User **admin** (Password: **admin**) has been added to access the admin
  applications */host-manager* and */manager*)
* Documentation and examples have been removed
* Command: `/opt/karaf/bin/deploy-and-run.sh` which links .kar files from */maven* to
  */opt/karaf/deploy* and then calls `karaf run`
* Sets `-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom` for faster startup times
  (though a bit less secure)

### Debugging

You can enable remote debugging by setting `JAVA_DEBUG` to any value:

  * **JAVA_DEBUG** If set remote debugging will be switched on
  * **JAVA_DEBUG_PORT** Port used for remote debugging. Default: 5005
